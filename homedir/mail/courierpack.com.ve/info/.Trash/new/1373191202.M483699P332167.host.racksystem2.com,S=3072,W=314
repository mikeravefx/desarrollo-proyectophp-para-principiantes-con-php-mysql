Hello my good friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
How are you today? Hope all is well with you and your family? I hope this mail finds you in an excellent condition of health. But if you do not remember me, you have received an email from me in the past regarding a multi-million-dollar business proposal which we never concluded. I am using this opportunity to inform you that this multi-million-dollar business has been concluded with another Merchant who financed it to a logical conclusion.</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
I thank you for your great effort towards our unfinished transfer of fund into your account, due to one reason or the other best to known you at that time. Due to the effort, courage and trustworthiness you showed during the course of the transaction, I want to compensate you and show my gratitude to you with the sum of One million united states dollars (US$1,000,000.00)</DIV>
<DIV>

I have left an international certified bank draft for you worth abuot US$1,000,000.00 cashable anywhere in the world. My dear friend, please contact my account officer Rev. Kingsley Nkrumah so that he will send the bank draft to you without any delay. At the moment, I'm very busy here in Russia, trying to invest my own share of the funds with my new partner. Please I will like you to accept this token with good faith as this is from the bottom of my heart.</DIV>
