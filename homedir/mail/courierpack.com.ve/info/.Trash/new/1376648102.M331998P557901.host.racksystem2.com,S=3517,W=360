Dear friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am John Woodhouse (Esq) of WALLACE LLP, London, United Kingdom. I was the personal attorney to Andreas Schranner, a German who worked at Mount Resources Ltd, a geologist by profession who died in AF4590 crash since 2000 along side with his entire family (wife Maria,their daughter Andrea Eich, her husband Christian, and their children Katharina 8, and Maximilian 10).</DIV>

<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Before his death, he deposited the sum of Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling with a bank here in London. This bank has recently notified me of their intention to confisicate this funds if i do not present the beneficiary or the deceased representative. Following this mandate, i have been forced to present any of the family members of my late client to the bank, but all my efforts to reach his relatives has been unsuccessful.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I have contacted you purely on the personal conviction of trust and confidence to assist in the claim and release of this funds to you for our mutual benefits. I will use my recognized office to prepare every necessary document as proof, furnish you with adequate information about my late client that will back you up in this claim and i shall provide all legal services to warrant the release of this funds to you as the beneficiary. At the successful completion of this transaction, we shall share the funds, 40% for you and 60% for me.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
As i await your positive response, i would appreciate if you could keep this proposal secret even if you are not capable or do not want to assist me.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I look forward to your prompt reply.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Respectfully yours,</DIV>
